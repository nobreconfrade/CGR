glmaze V1.1a - (c) 2001 by Till Harbaum, t.harbaum@web.de

glMaze is a multiplayer maze game based on the opengl 3d graphics
engine.  If a command line argument is present, glmaze tries to
interpret this as the server name to connect to. If no argument was
given, glmaze becomes the master client and starts a local server. Up
to six players can join a session. Only the master client can start
the session. Other players can join a running game. The game stops
when the first player reaches ten kills. The player with the top score
at this moment is the winner.

INSTALLATION

The game requires some libraries to be installed on the system. These
are OpenGL (libgl and libglx), the simple direct media layer (libSDL)
and its sound lib (libSDLmixer).

Just type 'make' and 'make install' and you should be done ...

MUSIC
